look at a specific number theory theorem
extensibility to general things
fight what you know, infinite truths and infinite of infinities
    the astute listener will realize that both are uncountable infinities

ppl say math is important or critical thinking
here are some concrete helpful things about math
discussing definitions
counterexamples
accepting being wrong, and being ok with it
    making the argument not personal
evaluating consequences
exploring assumptions
being able to abstract and understand things
    writing papers as a proof

a mathematicians apology
the last thing i want to discuss is my personal experience into mathematics
i liked math in high school and i was always pretty good at it
started to hate math
became an ordeal, less interesting and enjoyable
less about the purity of the subject and more about the grade and the fear
and thats not a good reason to take any class
so i encourage you to see mathematics for its purity and its beauty and enjoy it as it is, not as a proof of your intelligence
and if your interest is math, then follow your passion
and if your interest change like mine did then thats ok, change your direction
but i want to encourage you to follow what you love and find a direction that is meaningful and interesting to you

The actual talk:
** Introduction **
Hi! My name is Justin, and I graduated from TAS 2013. I'm currently a senior at
Columbia University studying mathematics and computer science, with a minor in
architecture and art history.
I'm very underqualified to be "giving a talk," so instead I'd like to just chat
with you guys about a couple of things. I had three things I wanted to discuss:
how to learn math, why studying math is important, and my personal experience
studying mathematics.

** How to learn math **
So let's get started with the first segment: how to learn math.
This is a section from the textbook I was using for my Modern Algebra class in
my sophomore year. Don't worry about not understanding the specific bits,
between you and me I barely understand the specific bits anymore. I put this
here because I really like the wording- I think it's hilarious.
"surrender easily" evokes this image of this old British dude brandishing a
theorem at a Big Bad Polynomial in a valiant mathematical duel. I liked the idea
of fighting every theorem, every math problem, of seeing solving problems as a
way to make them yield & surrender.

I like this comic and this quote a whole lot. In my freshman year, when I was
first studying proof based math, I was taking and getting ruined by a linear
algebra course. I went to my math professor Mu Tao Wang's office hours  in a
desperate but unsuccessful attempt to make some sense of the mess that was proof
based linear algebra in my head. I wanted some advice as to how to study, and
how to begin properly learning the material and really understanding it. He gave
me some advice that has slowly made more sense as I've studied and learned more
math, and he told me that the way to properly read the material was to engage
it. The way to learn a theorem is to test it and try it and challenge it, to see
under what general cases it holds true, under what special cases it might not,
what the edges cases are, what part of the theorem uses which of the given,
which conditions are necessary, to grapple with it until you've proven to
yourself without a doubt that it is true. In my experience, that's a very
important part of learning math. It's easy to accept certain things as true by
handwaving and accepting just the right amount of fuzziness to avoid hurting
your brain, but I think to properly learn a subject you must fight it. Why is
this the case? Can you prove that it is not? What counter examples come to mind,
and why are they not counter examples? In my opinion, proper math learning is a
very active endeavor- it is all too easy to let things go and accept a theorem
to be true, but then you cheat yourself out of real understanding.

I'd like to demonstrate this concept with a fairly simple theorem from number
theory.

The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new
discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...' Isaac Asimov
This idea extends to most other things. The best way to learn something is to do
battle with it, otherwise it goes in one hole and comes out the other.

This is a nice segway into the second part of the talk: why learning math is
useful.
** Discussing Definitions **
An important skill that mathematicians develop is comfort with definitions, and
fluidity and agility in learning and grappling with new definitions. After all,
mathematics is primarily concerned with "proving" things to be definitively
wrong or right, and in order to do so, you need to have strict and clear
definitions. In addition, since mathematics works in a space of more abstract
concepts, rigid definitions help us reason about more abstract things with more
logical precision. A good example of this is the definition of real numbers.

Real numbers as irrational, rational combined.
Important part of modern analysis and set theory was the rigid mathematical
definition of real numbers.
Still not a clear benefit. Important in arguments about race, about gender,
in your relationships, political,

** Finding counterexamples **
Another important part of discourse is finding examples and counterexamples
an important part of evaluating abstract claims is by looking at specific
examples and counterexamples
really important in mathematics to be able to evaluate edge cases, to be able to
study a claim and support it via examples or disprove it via counterexamples
we make a lot of unproven claims and we hear a lot of unproven claims, and being
able to identify edge cases is important. I say this also as a programmer, it's
very important to be able to identify where an algorithm or a program might go
wrong and the important examples to check. After all, not all examples are
equally important. I can say that x*y where x and y are integers will
always be positive, and you can list as many positive integers as you like, but
ultimately the important edge case is where x or y is a negative integer and the
other is not.

** Embracing wrong-ness **
Mathematical discourse is very unique in that most parties (or parties that are
good are it or at least reasonable about it) easily switch claims and discourse
is based entirely upon the validity of the argument. This is very different from
most other forms of discourse, where
this is because mathematicians are primarily concerned with the empirically
provable truth beyond doubt through logic and building upon assumptions.
Therefore, we're most interested in truth, and arguments are not personal and
emotions are not attached as often as they are. This is an important quality to
embrace in all discourse- to free yourself and your emotions from your argument
and be open and willing to discuss new points of view in the pursuit of truth.

** Evaluating consequences **
We saw this earlier in the theorem we looked at together, but an important
aspect of mathematics is evaluating consequences. When we look at a theorem,
what are the consequences and extensions of this new theorem? This examination
is important for two reasons:
We either discover new interesting areas to explore, or we discover logical
extensions that are inconsistent with existing knowledge, in which we've
disproved the theorem.
The same idea is useful in evaluating general claims. Oftentimes, without
evaluating the validity of the argument itself, by examining its consequences,
we can evaluate the claim itself.

** Exploring Underlying assumptions **
Mathematics is often regarded as rigor incarnate, but just like when we discovered
2 other types of geometry different from Euclidean geometry, the
underlying claims and assumptions of arguments are very important. As such, when
we evaluate new theorems, an important technique is to evaluate the assumptions
behind the theorem, and try to understand the theorem in context to its
assumptions. It also lends itself to extensions as we change and manipulate the
assumptions. The idea is to figure out the building blocks upon which the
theorem is constructed.
Another aspect of this is that in mathematical proofs, each step has an
underlying assumption or intent behind it (we call this motivation). By
understanding the **big idea** and the motivation behind proofs and theorems, we
can often better understand the theorem.
This is also applicable to the real world, since oftentimes when we find
ourselves confused, it is the mathematical and most helpful thing to do to just
evaluate the assumptions and understand the motivation behind things.

** abstracting and extracting **
Mathematics is, with perhaps the exception of philosophy, the most abstract
field. It is an important skill as a mathematician to be able to scale the
ladder of abstraction, and extract the essence of what is important in order to
understand and make arguments.
A good analogy is networking. When I type in google.com, a lot of stuff happens,
and all that stuff happens at different "layers of abstraction." I can discuss
hardware, I can discuss machine code, I can discuss bytes, I can discuss packets, I
can discuss higher level software, and these all exist at different levels of
abstraction. I don't have to understand hardware to do networking, and in fact I
myself do a fair amount of web development without understanding a lot of the
inner workings. I can turn on the lights without knowing exactly how the lights
are turned on.
In the same way, in mathematics, mathematicians often have to "scale" this
ladder of abstraction, from understanding definitions and theorems, to the
higher level argument, to the paper in relation to other papers, to the paper in
relation to what's interesting in the field.
This is important, because to understand certain things there is no need to
understand it to its absolute detail- you can extract what you need by
abstracting and black boxing what you don't.
I actually write my papers in the same way that I write my mathematical proofs-
the ability to evaluate consequences, explore assumptions, find counterexamples,
provide definitions, and abstract arguments is really useful. most of my
"brainstorming" and sketching actually comes in a really similar form as a math
proof.

** my personal experience **
The last thing I want to talk about is my personal experience into mathematics
I liked math in high school and I was always pretty good at it
Math was kind of boring to me before though, and it was an ok class but never
that interesting
numbers and geometric shapes and basic algebra was easy to pick up, and it made
sense, but the number chugging system of equations and find the length of the
third side problems were super boring to me.
I spent most of 11th grade mathematics drawing penises on my TI-84 by graphing
them. In fact, I dropped ms connors honors class because I thought it was too
hard and math was not that interesting.
I started enjoying math in my senior year. I took calculus in IB math and I
thought it was much more interesting, and I mentioned to Ms. Connor that I found
that type of math interesting. The wonderful teacher that she is, Ms. Connor
gave me a ton of her own material and I started working through all the calculus
notes. Soon I was doing a ton of math outside of school, and it took up all of
my time. I was bored for a long time, and math was deeply fascinating to me. I
enjoyed learning at my own pace and being able to move as quickly or as slowly
as I wanted to.  For the first time, I saw how interesting mathematics was, and
how astonishing it was that everything just worked. It was beautifully shocking
every time I learned a new concept and saw how it just fit. I was convinced that
mathematics was art, and happily spent hours learning and appreciating the
beauty of mathematics. When I went to college, I was set on studying
mathematics, which was what was wanted (W5).

But in venturing forth into what I would describe as "real" mathematics, I
started stumbling into some roadblocks. Mathematics was (and rightfully so) no
longer the joyous, self-paced journey it was before, and instead made rigorous
and competitive by difficult material, constant problem sets, impossible exams,
and smarter classmates. Drowned in the feeling that I was bad at math, I slowly
began to lose my love of math, and I slowly forgot why I enjoyed mathematics at
all. I came in as an intended pure math major, wanting to get a Ph.D. in math,
and started second semester in a joint math/computer science major, goals now
very far from a math professorship. Worst of all, when people asked me "why do
you still do so much math?" I could not find a good answer.

When I began studying for my final in May, all I could think about and worry
about was my grade. Math was no longer enjoyable or interesting, but instead an
ordeal that I had to get through. The awe and respect I had for mathematics was
now replaced by fear and trepidation, and I regarded the final much like a
dreaded visit to the dentist's office- painful, yet unavoidable. I got a 60% on
my first college final and it was curved to a 69%, and I just had this drowning
feeling like I was bad at math, something that I found so deeply enjoyable.
But once I actually started studying the material, I underwent an amazing
change- I once again began to appreciate mathematics. The way in which the
material would expand in a wholly unexpected direction, and yet remain
undeniable true and verifiable once again drew my awe and fascination. The way
Greene's Theorem, Stoke's Theorem, and Gauss's Theorem related made intuitive
sense to me, and the picture that was so hard to keep clear slowly lost its fog.
By the time I finished studying, I re-found my love of mathematics, but also a
deep sense of guilt that I had once forgotten it.


The drive to do anything for the purpose of pursuing grades or prestige or
boosting your college resume is a bad reason to do anything. It becomes less
about the purity and enjoyment of the subject and more about what comes with the
subject. so my encouragement for you all is to see mathematics for its purity
and its beauty and enjoy it as it is, not as a proof of your intelligence, not
as a way to get into college, not as a "smart thing to do after school." IF your
interest is in math, then follow your passion
For me, personally, my interest was math, but now I'm more engaged in computer
science. And thats ok. if your interest change like mine did, then that's also
ok, just change your direction
but I say this because I want to encourage you to follow what you love and find
a direction that is meaningful and interesting to you. And if you aren't sure
what that is, just do interesting things until you figure it out.
