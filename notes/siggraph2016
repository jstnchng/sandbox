SIGGRAPH 2016 Notes

* Get in Shape *
- labor intensive to represent spline surfaces, requires set # of CV
- hard to do complex shapes (rigid deformities)
- autospline architecture
    - knot objects
        - transformable, serve as a pivot
        - serve as multiple CVs
        - made from discrete scene primitives
    - spline
        - one or two knots
        - serve as curves, no literal CVs for splines
- knot properties:
    define point in space as spline intersections
- allows for simpler manipulation of complex shapes
- discussed in relation to Hank's tentacles from Finding Dory

* Deadpool *
- cloud rendering (servers on the cloud)
- provides easy rendering and sharing files
- parallelism in cloud rendering
    - linear run time => parallelism
- "linear usage of blades you own to parallel usage of blades you don't own"

* Delivering Doomdays, Meteor FX *
- heat shield, plasma, lightning, wind field, smoke trails, etc.
* Volcano *
- big scale, huge simulation time
- use checkpoints to reduce render time (save points)
- wedges on top of initial simulation
- initially low res for coarse behavior
    - hard to apply shaping forces and low res -> high res changes look a lot
- use base and then deform, retime, extend, combine (4 transformations)
    - reuse simulations
- sample to points, deform, then rebuild the shape
- wedges, isosurfaces (?)
- combine surfaces

* Physically based rendering *
- microfacet vs microflakes (?)
- multiscale BRDF
    - treat as finite area
- wave models
- band limiting light (1-100 nano), nanogeometry, diffraction

* Piper *
- water as volume, not as surface (defers rendering)
- GIN, follow geometry of the beach
- tree of transformations
Lighting
- subjects not objects (framed close)
- cognizant of environment
    - water as character
    - shifts of time of day, e.g. morning w softer diffuse light
- authenticity not reality
    - semblance of reality not mimicking
- physical lights & camera for realistic images, but shy away from hyper detail
- establish world and then stay consistent inside the world
    - physical lights and camera, not physical materials
- feature selection of iconic times
- soft colors in the morning
  visceral change in midday (hot, harsh, but not unappealing)
- let it reflect/ refract real world
- position lights physically in space

* Inner Workings *
- discuss different shot types

* Human Body Digitization *
- Translate humans to graphics
- trending: view point videos, virtual avatars, VR and AR
- social interaction thru cyberspace
    - visual humans
- different components
    - hair, face, clothes, body, hands all require different models
- realtime 3d scanning instead of combining images from different angles into 1
- parameters control shape of the body
    - extract best parameters for capturing body
- faces
    - linear models + joint representation
- hair
    - physical model (not deterministic)
- correspondence
    - figure out correspondence between images
- use template to model scan result
- propagate correspondence thru holes
    - propagate textures
- faces
    - motion capture, digital face creation
    - "pinscreen"

* Dance Correspondence w Convolution Neural Networks *
- non rigid correspondence doesn't work for large pose changes
- try to use vertices to match stuff instaed
    - cannot reliably handle holes in mesh
- use deep convolution neural net to get feature descriptors
- multiple segmentation to group classification => more similar descriptors
- fit segmented data

* Biomedical Imaging *
- lots of application, e.g. 3d brain scanning thru several images, reconstruct and practice difficult surgeries
- construction of teeth images, etc.

* Technical Papers Fast Forward *
- deep neural nets a big topic, used to obtain good representation of images
- lots of stuff on proper rigging
- lots of research on deformation & how to properly move complex shapes
- research on better monte carlo ray tracing
- research on better representation of hair, cloth, plants, etc.
