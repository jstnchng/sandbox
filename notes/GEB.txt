This post is a review of Godel Escher Bach: An
Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter. Technically this isn't really a
"tech" post so doesn't belong in this section, especially since this isn't
really a "technical" book but rather a book employing certain technical concepts
to discuss consciousness and intelligence.

I put it here for a few reasons:
I read this book because of Steve Yegge's blog post (link)
This book discusses stuff like grammars, the halting problem, recursively
enumerable sets, stacks, formal systems, and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
I don't have enough posts in this section and would like to add some more

This is a brilliant, brilliant book. This is one of the smartest books that I
have ever read, and Hofstadter has a gift in presenting concepts in a humorous,
but educational way, and connects examples from a wide range to bring together
these concepts. I read this book two summers ago during my lunch breaks at OTC
Markets, and after reading this book I started to read some reviews of it.

One of the reviews that I read was by Hofstadter himself, who 20 years later
lamented that most people misunderstood his book as a random collection of
things he finds interesting and about how "math, art, and music are totally
the same thing at the core man!!!" I found this tremendously funny and a little self gratifying
since I thought I was clearly not one of those people. Months later, when I was
recommending this book to a friend, he asked me what the book was about.

Confidently, I answered- "Oh, this book is about how Godel, Escher, and Bach's
ideas are connected and how systems are limited and each chapter is preceded by
a dialogue between Achilles and a tortoise..."

And that was when I realized I needed to reread the book.

So this is my 2nd attempt at reading through Hofstadter's book, with the goal
of really getting what this book is about. Unfortunately, this compression is lossy, as I have none of Hofstadter's wit,
intelligence, and language, so what he says in a few thousand words I am surely
incapable of capturing in a few sentences. My goal is just to better understand
what he is trying to convey in GEB and hopefully have a better groundwork for an
eventual third readthrough.

So what is GEB about?
GEB is, as Hofstadter describes it, a "very personal attempt to say how it is
that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter." It is an attempt to
describe the emergence of consciousness through what he calls strange loops,
a paradoxical level-crossing feedback loop.

These Strange Loops have examples in Escher, Bach, and Godel's work
prevent the creation of a complete consistent system
search for the "central solid essence" underpinning Godel Escher Bach


ch2
meaning arrives from meaningful isomorphisms between theorems of a formal system
& reality
once we've mapped meaningful isomorphism, symbols unavoidably take on meaning
natural question: how powerful can we create our formal systems to be? how much
reality can be mapped?
goal: create a formal system that has all statements of number theory and rules
that correspond to our reasoning

ch3
if we can create theorems in formal systems, are they the same as nontheorems?
in art, is the figure the same as the ground?
there are some formal systems where you can lay out theorems typographically and
cannot lay out nontheorems typographically (recursive, r.e. sets, and recursive,
r.e. languages)
potential complexity of formal systems to "go backwards" that results in
limitative results like the halting problem or godels incompleteness theorem

ch4
meaning arises from isomorphisms- NOT the symbols
therefore consistency is derived from interpretation, not a natural property of
formal systems
inconsistency as mathematical and logical
no system, sufficiently powerful, that is complete & consistent
formalized number theory is incomplete or inconsistent

ch5


ch 6
do messages have inherent meaning? do some messages carry meaning "context
free"
some messages have intrinsic meaning if intelligence is natural "intelligence as
our brains"

ch 7
intro to prop calc
all logic systems require some degree of faith eventually- difficulty in using
logic and reasoning to defend themselves
cant think out of system in prop calc- simple "formalized" derivations
human thought & prop calculus not a perfect isomorphism
    simple precise rules but doesn't mimic human reasoning
its simplicity is useful to be inserted into larger systems- if contradictions
come up its the fault of the larger system not prop calc
