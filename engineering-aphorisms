pain driven development 

tighten your feedback loop 

work on your efficiency with your tools. they donâ€™t directly help you in your development, but the more comfortable you are with your tools, the more you can focus. not through narrowing your focus but removing unnecessary stuff from your window 

pair programming is good, bc both speed each other up

the less precise you have to be the better

cultivate your impatience for your tools and processes, not people
