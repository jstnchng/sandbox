pain driven development 

tighten your feedback loop 

work on your efficiency with your tools. they donâ€™t directly help you in your development, but the more comfortable you are with your tools, the more you can focus. not through narrowing your focus but removing unnecessary stuff from your window 

pair programming is good, bc both speed each other up

the less precise you have to be the better
  (aka "not having to aim")

Cultivate Your Impatience 
 - for the things that break your flow
 - for machines, software, for the number of steps it takes you to do something
 - this is not for people, you should have deep patience for the people around you, that's a part of kindness, which is a virtue
 - These are hard to recognize, because those things are often habits and we
   even optimize for them (we get good at repeating the steps, even though we'd
   be better off eliminating them -- I see this as related to obsessive compulsive
   behaviors)
